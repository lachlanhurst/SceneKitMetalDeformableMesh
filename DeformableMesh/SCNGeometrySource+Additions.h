// In iOS 11.4, this function is defined behind the SCN_ENABLE_METAL macro. It defaults to 1, but Swift can't see it, so we don't end up
// with an appropriate Swift version. This extension allows us to properly use this method.
//
// I am not a Swift developer, so I'm not sure if there's a better way to do this, but it works...
